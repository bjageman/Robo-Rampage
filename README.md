# Robo Rampage

This is a digital clone of the popular board game **Robo Rally**. While it doesn't use any of the assets from the original board game, it has all of the same rules. 

This project is currently in development so please doesn't expect any of this to work properly.

## Setup

TBD

## How to Play

Players will program one bot while competing with other players in order to either capture the flag or destroy all other robots, depending on the goal of the game.
